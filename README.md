## _Design A Landing Page For Wren's New Range: Vogue_
## Design specifications
The feature and element requirements on the page are as follows:

- Information on the new kitchen range Vogue
- The kitchen planner
- Celebrity/Public case studies
- Tutorial videos for kitchen installations/construction
- Lead generation to win flat pack kitchen
- PR campaign coverage (competition & wren)
- Social media hashtag reference Wrenovations
- Optimize for "flat-pack Kitchens" & "fitted kitchens"
- Use examples of custom JS
- Drive to converting pages via call to action

## Viewing the landing page
I developed this project using Visual Studio Code, to view this page in a live interactive environment, I utilised a vs-code extension called "Live Server Preview", this allowed me to render the page in real time without having to run a local server or application.

In Order to view this landing page & test on various devices, I utilised Chrome's Dev Tools to emulate a tablet and mobile view.

## Future Updates
Here is a list of features/updates I would include upon spending further time on the project.
- Google tag manager integration
- Utilise slick.js carousel
- Send the contact form to a CRM
